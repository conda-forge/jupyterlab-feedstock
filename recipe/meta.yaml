  summary: >
    An extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing, based
    on the Jupyter Notebook and Architecture. Currently in beta.

  description: >
    JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter. It
    offers all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook
    (notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a
    flexible and powerful user inteface. Eventually, JupyterLab will replace
    the classic Jupyter Notebook after JupyterLab reaches 1.0.

    JupyterLab can be extended using extensions that are npm packages and use
    our public APIs. You can search for the GitHub topic jupyterlab-extension
    to find extensions. To learn more about extensions, see our user
    documentation.

    The beta releases are suitable for general usage. For JupyterLab extension
    developers, the extension APIs will continue to evolve until the 1.0
    release.
